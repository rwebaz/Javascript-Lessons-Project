# Js Maps

A **Map** in Javascript is an ordered list of *key-value* pairs of any type or combination.

{% include toc-flammarion.md %}

## Coercement

Items are retrieved from a Javascript **Map** by use of the *get* statement.

In addition, items are added to a Javascript **Map** by use of the *set* statement.

**Note**. Javascript *Object* properties when used as the *key* in a **key-value** pair are normally coerced into a *string* by the Javascript engine.

Not so when using a Javascript **Map** in ES6[[2](#ES6){:.red}].

Either the *key* or the *value* can be of any type.

So, the *key* of a **key-value** pair can be of any type.

And, the *value* of a **key-value** pair can be of any type, as well.
