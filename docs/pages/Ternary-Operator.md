### The Code

```ruby
const cartItemCount = isAuthenticatedUser ? 1 : 0;
```

## Steps of the Algorithm

```ruby
// Store in a constant variable named `cartItemCount` ...
// Is our subject an `authenticated user`?
// If so by placing a Boolean function upon the element  ...
// Returns `true`
// Statement resolves to `1`
// Or, 
// After initially placing a Boolean function upon the element ...
// Returns `false`
// Statement resolves to `0`
// Stop
```
