## Number()

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

Forcing or *casting* a variable's *type* in Javascript may be performed with the *primitive constructor* for the *Number* object `Number()`.

### Coercement

A variable container declared with the *primitive constructor* for the *Number* object `Number()` may optionally accept numerical values masquerading as a *string*.

However, the Javascript engine will attempt to coerce the *string* into a *number* and if the *string* contains characters other than *numerical digits*, and *if* the Javascript engine is not comfortable with the resulting *value* when tested, a value of *Not a Number*, or `NaN` will be returned.

**Note**. Javascript also provides a primitive constructor for the *Boolean* object and the *String* object, as well.

As is the case for the primitive constructor for the *Number* object `Number()` ...

Both the primitive constructor for the *Boolean* object `Boolean()` and the primitive constructor for the *String* object `String()` make a variable `var` immutable with respect to *type*.

## Boolean()

Variable containers that have been created with the primitive constructor for the *Boolean* object `Boolean()` may only hold one of two distinct *state*.

The value placed into the *variable container* may be a `true` value, or the value placed into the *variable container* may be a `false` value.

Because the variable `var` was constructed with the primitive constructor for the *Boolean* object `Boolean()`, the *type* of value that can be placed into the *variable container* is the now immutably fixed `bool` type.

## String()

When declared via the primitive constructor for the *String* object `String()`, a variable `var` returns `false` when tested if the string value provided is the *empty* string `""`, if the string value provided contains only the numeral zero (0) `"0"`, or if the value provided is either `undefined` or `null`.

**Note**. When initializing a *string* at the time of declaration via the primitive constructor for the *String* object `String()`, the values of `"NaN"`, `"null"`, `"undefined"`, `"true"`, and `"false"` when tested *will return true* if operated upon by the `toString` method of the object *String* ...!

In other words, the values declared for *Number* at the time of declaration when utilizing the primitive constructor for the *Number* object `Number()` may be *changed* to the different type *string* if operated upon by the `toString` method of the *String* object.

So, an odd case of explicitly changing an immutably declared variable `var` as to *type* does exist for *Number* when otherwise *implicitly* Javascript would simply return `false` when tested for *string* and `NaN` when tested for *number*.
